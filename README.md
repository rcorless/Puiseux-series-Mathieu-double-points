# Puiseux-series-Mathieu-double-points

The file BlanchClemmDoublePoints.maple is a Maple Workbook which contains code that will allow the user to locate double points to arbitrary precision and to compute Puiseux series expansions of the eigenvalue about those double points, using Newton's method in series.  This method is described in the paper Brimacombe, Corless, and Zamir: Computation of the Mathieu Functions, a historical perspective.
